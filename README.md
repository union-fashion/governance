# Union Fashion API Governance
This is a repo for managing the governance in place across Union Fashion API operations. It consists of two proof of concept (POC) Postman collections that utilize the testing infrastructure of Postman to not just test an instance of an API, but also pull the OpenAPI from the Postman API and test the surface area of the API design.

You can [watch a video of me working with the API design governance collection as part of the Union Fashion product API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYZz_0mTrn0). The full ApI lifecycle one is still only about 65% realized, and I am still pushing forward to support the full Union Fashion API lifecycle.

I recommend using the products API for Union Fashion as it is the furthest along, and I've been using in several demos. If there is a rule or questions about the collections, submit an issue using the GitHub issues for this repository.
